Problems.Euler Square.py has all the methods and parameters specific for that problem
Controller.controller.py has the controller who has all the algorithms
domain.Particle.py has the class Particle for PSO
View.EulerSquareUi.py is the Form for the eulerSquare problem
Tests has the .py for the tests to be run

I know it's messy but i'm trying to add all the labs into a big project rather than making lots of smaller projects
